This talk was a visual introduction to algebraic topology. 
It began by introducing the notion of “working up to homotopy” and the fundamental group. 
Then it introduced covering spaces as way of translating algebraic data to more geometric language.
It concluded by giving a visualization of computing the fundamental group of the circle using the language of covering spaces.
